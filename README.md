## About the Project
Based on the low-cost wearable device called Swimu, this repository contains an application for mobile and/or Web devices that allows the recording of data of swimming sessions training. At the end of a workout, the mobile application collects the data read by the sensor and displays a dashboard that shows the training statistics, such as swimming styles, distances, etc.

## Setup
